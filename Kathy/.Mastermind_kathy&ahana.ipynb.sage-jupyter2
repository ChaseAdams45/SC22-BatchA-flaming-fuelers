The steps of Mastermind are as follows:\n\n*   The computer plays first by setting a 4-digit number.\n*   The user now tries their first attempt at guessing the number.\n*   If the user succeeds in their first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) they win the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then the computer hints by revealing which digits or numbers the user got correct.\n*   The game continues till the user eventually is able to guess the number entirely.\n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"FIl5ePMRnNbH"},"pos":0,"type":"cell"}
